# Dynamic Resource Allocation Framework for Hospital Management Using Risk-Aware Scheduling

This project is a **hospital resource management system** that uses **risk-aware scheduling** to dynamically allocate critical resources such as beds, staff, and equipment based on patient risk profiles and hospital capacity.

---

## 🏥 Project Objective

To design and implement a smart hospital management system that:
- Allocates resources dynamically using patient risk assessments.
- Reduces manual overhead in critical resource planning.
- Improves response time and quality of patient care during peak loads or emergencies.

---

## 📌 Key Features

- ✅ Dynamic resource allocation algorithm
- 📊 Patient risk evaluation and categorization
- 🧠 Risk-aware scheduling engine
- 🏥 Hospital dashboard for real-time resource status

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python (Flask)** – Backend development
- **HTML/CSS/Bootstrap** – Frontend design
- **SQLite / MySQL** – Database
- **Git** – Version control
- **GitHub** – Repository hosting
